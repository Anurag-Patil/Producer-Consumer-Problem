# Producer-Consumer-Problem
It contains algorithms for very well known producer consumer problem using locks and semaphores.

Input should be given using file "inp-params.txt" consisting of the following parameters:
1. capacity, Buffer size
2. np, no. of producer thread.
3. nc, no. of consumer thread.
4. cntp, no. of times each producer thread produces the item.
5. cntc, no. of times each consumer thread produces the item.
6. mup, average of exponentially distributed time for which each process produces an item.
7. muc, average of exponentially distributed time for which each process consumes an item.
